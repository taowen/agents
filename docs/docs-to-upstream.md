# Docs to Upstream

This file tracks documentation in this repo that should be pushed to [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/).

## Ready to Upstream

These docs are complete and should be added to the official Cloudflare docs site:

## Partially Covered on CF Docs

These topics exist on developers.cloudflare.com but our repo has additional content:

| Doc                                        | What's Different                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [agent-class.md](./agent-class.md)         | Deep architectural explanation (DO → Server → Agent layers)              |
| [state.md](./state.md)                     | Comprehensive patterns, workflow integration, state vs SQL guidance      |
| [http-websockets.md](./http-websockets.md) | Full lifecycle hooks, connection tags, per-connection state, hibernation |
| [workflows.md](./workflows.md)             | `AgentWorkflow` class details, typed RPC, state sync from workflows      |
| [scheduling.md](./scheduling.md)           | AI-assisted scheduling, comparison table, more patterns (retry, backoff) |
| [client-sdk.md](./client-sdk.md)           | Comprehensive reference, async query, streaming, MCP integration         |

## Notes

- The official CF docs have good coverage of: State Management, Scheduling, Client SDK (`useAgent`, `AgentClient`), WebSockets, HTTP/SSE, AI Models, RAG, Browse the Web, Configuration
- When upstreaming, check if the feature is already partially documented and merge/extend rather than duplicate
- Keep this list updated as docs are pushed upstream
