# @cloudflare/ai-chat

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#899](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/899) [`04c6411`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/04c6411c9a73fe48784d7ce86150d62cf54becda) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Refactor AIChatAgent: extract ResumableStream class, add WebSocket ChatTransport, simplify SSE parsing.

  **Bug fixes:**
  - Fix `setMessages` functional updater sending empty array to server
  - Fix `_sendPlaintextReply` creating multiple text parts instead of one
  - Fix uncaught exception on empty/invalid request body
  - Fix `CF_AGENT_MESSAGE_UPDATED` not broadcast for streaming messages
  - Fix stream resumption race condition (client-initiated resume request + replay flag)
  - Fix `_streamCompletionPromise` not resolved on error (tool continuations could hang)
  - Fix `body` lost during tool continuations (now preserved alongside `clientTools`)
  - Fix `clearAll()` not clearing in-memory chunk buffer (orphaned chunks could flush after clear)
  - Fix errored streams never cleaned up by garbage collector
  - Fix `reasoning-delta` silently dropping data when `reasoning-start` was missed (stream resumption)
  - Fix row size guard using `string.length` instead of UTF-8 byte count for SQLite limits
  - Fix `completed` guard on abort listener to prevent redundant cancel after stream completion

  **New features:**
  - `maxPersistedMessages` — cap SQLite message storage with automatic oldest-message deletion
  - `body` option on `useAgentChat` — send custom data with every request (static or dynamic)
  - Incremental persistence with hash-based cache to skip redundant SQL writes
  - Row size guard — automatic two-pass compaction when messages approach SQLite 2MB limit
  - `onFinish` is now optional — framework handles abort controller cleanup and observability
  - Stream chunk size guard in ResumableStream (skip oversized chunks for replay)
  - Full tool streaming lifecycle in message-builder (tool-input-start/delta/error, tool-output-error)

  **Docs:**
  - New `docs/chat-agents.md` — comprehensive AIChatAgent and useAgentChat reference
  - Rewritten README, migration guides, human-in-the-loop, resumable streaming, client tools docs
  - New `examples/ai-chat/` example with modern patterns and Workers AI

  **Deprecations (with console.warn):**
  - `createToolsFromClientSchemas()`, `extractClientToolSchemas()`, `detectToolsRequiringConfirmation()`
  - `tools`, `toolsRequiringConfirmation`, `experimental_automaticToolResolution` options
  - `addToolResult()` (use `addToolOutput()`)

### Patch Changes

- [#897](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/897) [`994a808`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/994a808abb5620b57aba4e0e0125bbcd89c1ae5f) Thanks [@alexanderjacobsen](https://github.com/alexanderjacobsen)! - Fix client tool schemas lost after DO restart by re-sending them with CF_AGENT_TOOL_RESULT

- [#912](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/912) [`baa87cc`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/baa87cceccd11ce051af5d2918831ec8eddd86fb) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Persist request context across Durable Object hibernation.

  Persist `_lastBody` and `_lastClientTools` to SQLite so custom body fields and client tool schemas survive Durable Object hibernation during tool continuation flows (issue #887). Add test coverage for body forwarding during tool auto-continuation, and update JSDoc for `OnChatMessageOptions.body` to document tool continuation and hibernation behavior.

- [#913](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/913) [`bc91c9a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/bc91c9a63aefa2faf37db2ad7b5f3f382a1de101) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Sync `_lastClientTools` cache and SQLite when client tools arrive via `CF_AGENT_TOOL_RESULT`, and align the wire type with `ClientToolSchema` (`JSONSchema7` instead of `Record<string, unknown>`)

- [#910](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/910) [`a668155`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/a668155598aa8cd2f53b724391d1c538f3e96a2d) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - Add structural message validation and fix message metadata on broadcast/resume path.

  **Structural message validation:**

  Messages loaded from SQLite are now validated for required structure (non-empty `id` string, valid `role`, `parts` is an array). Malformed rows — from corruption, manual tampering, or schema drift — are logged with a warning and silently skipped instead of crashing the agent. This is intentionally lenient: empty `parts` arrays are allowed (streams that errored mid-flight), and no tool/data schema validation is performed at load time (that remains a userland concern via `safeValidateUIMessages` from the AI SDK).

  **Message metadata on broadcast/resume path:**

  The server already captures `messageMetadata` from `start`, `finish`, and `message-metadata` stream chunks and persists it on `message.metadata`. However, the client-side broadcast path (multi-tab sync) and stream resume path (reconnection) did not propagate metadata — the `activeStreamRef` only tracked `parts`. Now it also tracks `metadata`, and `flushActiveStreamToMessages` includes it in the partial message flushed to React state. This means cross-tab clients and reconnecting clients see metadata (model info, token usage, timestamps) during streaming, not just after the final `CF_AGENT_CHAT_MESSAGES` broadcast.

### Patch Changes

- [#882](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/882) [`584cebe`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/584cebe882f437a685b96b26b15200dc50ba70e1) Thanks [@alexanderjacobsen](https://github.com/alexanderjacobsen)! - Fix multi-step client tool calling: pass stored client tool schemas to `onChatMessage` during tool continuations so the LLM can call additional client tools after auto-continuation. Also add a re-trigger mechanism to the client-side tool resolution effect to handle tool calls arriving during active resolution.

- [#891](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/891) [`0723b99`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/0723b9909f037d494e0c7db43e031c952578c82e) Thanks [@ask-bonk](https://github.com/apps/ask-bonk)! - Fix `getCurrentAgent()` returning `undefined` connection when used with `@cloudflare/ai-chat` and Vite SSR

  Re-export `agentContext` as `__DO_NOT_USE_WILL_BREAK__agentContext` from the main `agents` entry point and update `@cloudflare/ai-chat` to import it from `agents` instead of the `agents/internal_context` subpath export. This prevents Vite SSR pre-bundling from creating two separate `AsyncLocalStorage` instances, which caused `getCurrentAgent().connection` to be `undefined` inside `onChatMessage` and tool `execute` functions.

  The `agents/internal_context` subpath export has been removed from `package.json` and the deprecated `agentContext` alias has been removed from `internal_context.ts`. This was never a public API.

- [#886](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/pull/886) [`4292f6b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/commit/4292f6ba6d49201c88b09553452c3b243620f35b) Thanks [@whoiskatrin](https://github.com/whoiskatrin)! - Forward custom body fields from client requests to `onChatMessage` options

  Custom data sent via `prepareSendMessagesRequest` or the AI SDK's `body` option in `sendMessage` is now available in the `onChatMessage` handler through `options.body`. This allows passing dynamic context (e.g., model selection, temperature, custom metadata) from the client to the server without workarounds.
