# AGENTS.md — packages/agents

The core Agents SDK, published to npm as `agents`. This is the most complex package in the monorepo.

## Package exports

Each export maps to a public entry point that users `import` from. These are the boundaries of the public API — changes here need a changeset.

| Import path            | Source file(s)               | Purpose                                                             |

## Build

```bash
npm run build           # runs tsx scripts/build.ts
```

Uses **tsdown** (ESM-only, with .d.ts generation and sourcemaps). Build entry points are explicitly listed in `scripts/build.ts` — if you add a new export, add it there too.

After build, `oxfmt --write` formats the generated `.d.ts` files.

The `check:exports` script at the repo root verifies that every `exports` entry in `package.json` has a corresponding file in `dist/`.

## Testing

Four separate test suites, each with its own vitest config:

### Workers tests (`src/tests/`)

```bash
npm run test:workers    # or: vitest -r src/tests
```

Runs inside the Workers runtime via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Uses a `wrangler.jsonc` to configure Durable Object bindings, queues, workflows, etc. Tests cover: state, scheduling, routing, callable methods, WebSocket message handling, email routing, MCP protocol, workflows.

### React tests (`src/react-tests/`)

```bash
npm run test:react      # or: vitest -r src/react-tests
```

Runs in **Playwright (Chromium, headless)** via `vitest-browser-react`. A global setup script starts a miniflare worker on port 18787. Tests cover: `useAgent` hook, cache invalidation, cache TTL, state sync.

### CLI tests (`src/cli-tests/`)

```bash
npm run test:cli        # or: vitest -r src/cli-tests
```

Plain Node.js environment. Tests the `npx agents` CLI.

### Type-level tests (`src/tests-d/`)

Files ending in `.test-d.ts`. These use `expectTypeOf` / `assertType` to verify TypeScript types at compile time. They're checked by the typecheck script, not by vitest directly.

### E2E tests (`src/e2e/`)

```bash
npm run test:e2e        # or: vitest run src/e2e/e2e.test.ts
```

End-to-end tests that start real workers and test MCP server flows.

### Evals (`evals/`)

```bash
npm run evals           # runs evalite inside evals/
```

AI evaluation suite (scheduling accuracy, etc.). Requires API keys in `.env`.

## Key architecture notes

- **Agent extends partyserver's `Server`** — Durable Object lifecycle, WebSocket hibernation, and connection management come from `partyserver`. The Agent class adds state sync, RPC, scheduling, SQL, MCP client, email, and workflows on top.
- **State sync is bidirectional** — `this.setState()` on the server broadcasts to all connected clients; `agent.setState()` from the client sends to the server. Both directions use the same message format (`MessageType.CF_AGENT_STATE`).
- **RPC is reflection-based** — public methods on Agent subclasses are automatically callable from clients via `agent.call("methodName", ...args)`. Serialization constraints are enforced by the `Serializable` type system (`src/serializable.ts`).
- **Scheduling uses cron-schedule** — `this.schedule()` accepts delays, Dates, or cron strings. Schedules persist in SQLite and survive hibernation.
- **MCP has two sides** — `McpAgent` (in `mcp/index.ts`) lets you _build_ an MCP server. `MCPClientManager` (in `mcp/client.ts`) lets an Agent _connect to_ external MCP servers.

## Boundaries

- Every new public export needs: an entry in `package.json` `exports`, a build entry in `scripts/build.ts`, and a changeset
- `src/index.ts` is very large (~4300 lines) — be surgical with edits, understand the full context before changing
- The `partyserver`/`partysocket` dependency is foundational — don't try to replace it
- Peer dependencies (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/*`, `react`, `zod`) are optional — guard usage with runtime checks or separate entry points
